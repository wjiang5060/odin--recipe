      <h2> What is Japanese Ramen noodle soup?</h2>
      Ramen is a <strong> Japanese </strong> noodle dish. It consists of Chinese-style alkaline wheat noodles served in a meat-based broth, 
      often flavored with soy sauce or miso, and uses toppings such as sliced pork, nori, menma, and scallions. 
      Ramen has its roots in Chinese noodle dishes.
